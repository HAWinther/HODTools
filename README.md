# HODTools
Contains methods to create HOD mocks from a (Rockstar) halo catalog and do fitting of the HOD parameters to give mocks with matching 2-point correlation functions.

See main.cpp for example use.

MPI and OpenMP support, however MPI not implemented properly (only for correlation function evaluation).

Part of the code is based on an IDL code by Baojiu Li.
